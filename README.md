# Programing language

This is a programing language that was created using [Python Lex-Yacc](https://www.dabeaz.com/ply/).

The different files are present in the repository, such as the lexicon and the syntax used, as well as some sample programs that were created to test the syntaxis and functionality of the language.

This programing language is capable of doing basic mathematic operations, where the syntaxis was created using the syntaxis of C as inspiration.
